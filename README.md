## My-data-analyst-portfolio
I am a keen data analyst with experience of working on a number of the different projects. As part of my work with these projects I was able to collect, organize and explore the data in order to find and provide business insight, for example, in Project**HollywoodsMostProfitableStories** I was able to collect,clean the data using **RStudio** and **Power BI** to visualize the data; and in project**subsurface facture classification** I use the real data collected from the field survey and use the machine learning (**ML**) **KMean method** to analyze it. The result have been used into the engineering survey project.


I am proficient in **Python, R, SQL,my SQL,Tableau, AZure,Power Bi**

I have experience in designing and creating dashboards in main industry sectors, reported to clients and help company to make business decision.

I am confident in my data analytics skills and that my experience, attitude and communication skills would make me an ideal candidate for a data analyst role.
