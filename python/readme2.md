This is a very challenge real project in engineer survey. The aim is to find a processing method to anylze fracture monitor data which is **19 dimensional data** and continuing recored during 15 days.

<p>The key steps are **cleaning data, reducing dimensions,normalize different factors,ML learning modell build up,to study K=? in KMean method, and classified code refilled into the factures** 
  
Key code
```

model = RF1.fit(x_data,y_data)

print(model.score(x_data,y_data))

```
